# Library Management System - Database Processes

This project implements the database processes for a Library Management System using PostgreSQL. The system tracks members, books, loans, reservations, suppliers, and purchases. Key processes include managing book borrowing, overdue loans, and generating member activity reports.

## Key Features:
- **Book Borrowing**: Allows members to borrow books, with checks on violations.
- **Overdue Loan Management**: Retrieves and manages overdue loans with fine details.
- **Popular Books**: Identifies the most borrowed books in the system.
- **Member Information**: Provides detailed member data such as borrowing limits and violations.
- **Member Activity Analysis**: Generates activity reports for members based on their loans and reservations.
- **Monthly and Yearly Activity**: Tracks and reports on the most active borrowing periods.

These processes automate key functions in library operations, helping to manage data efficiently and ensuring smooth operations for both staff and members.
